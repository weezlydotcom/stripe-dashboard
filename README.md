# Simple Stripe Dashboard
One thing we wanted to do is to create a dashboard where we wanted to set what is our MRR goal, 
then data will be pulled from Stripe, what is the current MRR, ARR, and how much is left to the goal
and how many are on the trial. 

This entire dashboard is created in php, one page and password protected. 
Simple, yet effective.
