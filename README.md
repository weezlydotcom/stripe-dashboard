# Awesome Stripe Dashboard
This simple, yet powerful Stripe dashboard will allow you to set a MRR goal, and then connect to your Stripe
account and then data will be pulled from Stripe, your current current MRR, ARR, and how much is left to the goal
and how many are on the trial. This entire dashboard is created in PHP, one page and password protected. 

Simple, yet effective.
